# Data Structures in Go
I want to implement all the data structures in golang here.

### To run tests
`go test -v -count=1 ./...`
### To run a specific test
`go test -v -count=1 -run <name of the test> <path to package>`


- Stack
  - [Array based stack](stack/arraybased/stack.go)
  - [Linked list based stack](stack/linkedlistbased/stack_ll.go)
